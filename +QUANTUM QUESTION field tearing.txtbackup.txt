+QUANTUM QUESTION field tearing


WOULD a 3d orbital field or near 2d field literally TEAR about

MOLECULES or ORGANISMS (systems of molecules?)


Do we need to balance positive and negative or something to avoid ripping a human a part?  OR IM JUST BEING STUPID AND PARANOID?

maybe not....


WOULD THE FIELD LITERALLY HAVE TO BE 2d PURE 2d? and HELICAL or SPIRAL NOT 3d but 2d SPIRAL or vortex to make a 2d plane?

REMEMBER, that doesn't stop the need for QUANTUM PARADOXICAL RELAY STATIONS with ENCRYPTIOn
