Hello, I'm looking for a 3d design of a special video game gun that's a suppressed revolver with gas catcher and suppressor and compensator and folding stock but it's a 1892 Colt revolver 6 shooter.
Will have laser, optics, and optical red dot and reflex at 45 degrees.


the idea is to add scope mount, at top with exeskeleton, and front has supressor and a flap that hinges over the rotating chamber that seals it from gas escaping, works with neodynium magnet on incline or slope.
WIth manual release and manaual or electric drill clamping device.

Well the outer structure has parts that are 3d printed.
The exoskeleton outer structure that attaches somenhow to the pistol grips replacements and stock m4 adapter with rails above the pistol on that narrow band of metal going back and forth on that forward back axis.


And under rails for laser and maybe grenade launcher so long rail or shotgun kemod".  but there is also suppressor that is Chinese type 64 "Chinese suppressed pistol".

The parts that fold back are metal but use strong magnets that snap back into place.  The place in question, is not to the gun but another layer.... that inner layer that attaches to exeskelton is molded to the firearm and stuck on with glue or adhesive sealant, like boat silicon or special graphene powder gel paste.

I want this eventually to be a universal attachment exoskeleton or stock mod for any old school revolver
