1. VOICE TO TEXT IN GAME for the SHY PLAYERS ðŸ˜¦ ðŸ˜¦ ðŸ˜¦

-use windows voice recognition and a simulated keyboard pressing


2. GENRMAL MODE or NAPOLEAN MODE when ADMIN allows.

This is where one player is allowed to have a, not in real time, map of the battlefield on a second monitor where by it us updated when the user clicks a two button sequence with or with out those FUNKY side keys on a mouse.


Essentially a folder is watched for an in game screen shot, crop it, and displays it on a second screen.  Every time the NAPOLEAN pushes the 2 buttons it's updated.




3. MY PEACE THE RESISTANCE:


We are bringing social messaging to this game...IN THE GAME


And I buy that I mean, we willwith permission will allow users to add a small box overlay somewhere in their visual field in the game.


This box will display anything visual and audio!, such as GIF animations, pictures, video, whatever.... remember all with sound


With transparency attributes, we can include even a simple GUI for picking gifs/video/audio but also targeting specific players, teams, or groups of players.s



This ia all networked like an OLD SKOOL messaging system like ICQ or maybe it's DONE THROUGH IRC chat room, where tags indicate who the mesage is sent to (TEAM or indiviual player)  and text or instructions tell the receiving computer what image or video or file to play. But I guess everyone would have to have the same images...that's lame... they should be able to SEND in real time if it's a funny new reaction for example.

OR.  If it needs to be fast for a way to communicate intel....then people should have all the images, videos, gifs, whatever already on all the computers. So all that is needed is a networked command
