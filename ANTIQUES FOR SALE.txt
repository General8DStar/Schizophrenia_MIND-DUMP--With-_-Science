Hello,

My name is Kevin Yuan-Kung Huang.

My uncle and I are trying to auction and/or sell Ming and around that dynasty Vases.

They were given to my Uncle from my Granfather Boyle Huang or Huang Baoyu  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Palace_Museum.

We used to have many Chinese antiques, some that were even given to George Bush Senior.



We also have some buhdda statues we think are appraised for $13K.

For immediate auction, these items will also be emailed to other prominent auction houses in Canada.


Can someone please call and leave a message at 1 647 712 1984?

If not please leave a text message is best right now, I can only reply infrequently with email.

Thanks so much!
Be well :)

Best regards,
Kevin Yuan-Kung Huang
