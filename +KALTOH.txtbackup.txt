+KALTOH

2d or sticks -like hictory sticks of OTHELLO TILE so it's planes of moves at once


And the fractal shape and resultant time it takes goes into move average for kaltoh resultant latent image.

HOLO IMAGE.


But if it it s advanced kaltoh or 4D GO. you have a shifting time clock as a algorithm is neighter a set of number or simply philosophical knowledge, it must be  both.

To explain: 1 line is a set  time but the shape was resulaant of steps so a line as the base shape of TIME has no knowledge.


KNOWLEDGE OR CONCIOUSNESS in the universe can not exist with out first the line but with out it there is no universe to witness or observer but as with the first part would you rather have time, that is impossible as this boot loop argument continues. FUCK YOU WHitE Trash niggher loosers you kyte shivea little brown cunts JUST FUCKING DIE ALREADY.

But sureley memory is a component of the logical or philosophical  steps, as inertia is a property as well as a Time-reverse unit historically.
